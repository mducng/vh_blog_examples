# Verification Horizons Examples

Whenever I write a block entry on [Siemens Verification Horizons Blog](https://blogs.sw.siemens.com/verificationhorizons/) that contains code examples I create and run the examples in this repository.  Then I copy and paste the code from here into the blog post, thus avoiding embarassing syntax errors in my examples.

## Directory names

Most of these examples use courtines and run in a **cocotb** testbench. To run them, CD into the approriate directory and type `make`.

The directories are named, and sorted by date using the format `yy_mm_dd_<title of blog post>`

## Tox

The repository uses tox to ensure that all the examples compile and run after every push.
